This is the development repository for the embedded system created by me and Adam Polus as a diploma thesis.
The goal is to create the system that will collect data from sensors and pass them wirlessly to PC. 
The system will be attached to a drone and will provide constant data from accelerometers and microphones.
Data will held the information about vibrations generated by motors.
